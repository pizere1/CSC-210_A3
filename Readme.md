# A7 Linked Lists

Your readme should include the following information. **Each student** needs to submit all of this information, even when pair programming.

## Submission Details

Programming Partner Name (if you are submitting identical code):
N/A

Other Collaborators (submitting related but non-identical code):
N/A

Kudos/shout-out to particularly helpful members of the class or teaching staff:

Any references used besides JavaDoc and course materials:
I used geeks for geeks to understand more on operation on whole list including splice and transfers.

If you used AI, please describe how and the interaction between AI and your understanding of this assignment and specifically the related data structures and algorithms:
My tests initially couldn't run so, I consulted Chatgpt to figure out how to active Maven and get Junit working in my project.

## Reflection

What do you see as the benefits and downsides of working with linked lists instead of arrays? When might they be most useful versus limiting?
Working with list saves space if you remove an element from the list, and it makes it possible to add elements without copying over everything.
However, having indices would make accessing some specific elements faster than iterating through the whole list looking for one. 

What was the major challenge you faced in completing this assignment?
The major challenge I faced was making the Junit tests work for this specific project. At the beginning, they couldn't be compiled so it slowed my progress through the rest of the assignment until I figured it out. 

What do you feel you learned from this assignment?
This assignment made me reconsider my programming decisions repeatedly, to maximize the results in the fewer clearer lines. I usually write a lot of codes which can get tiresome to read through and debug, this assignment made me practice to cut them down.
